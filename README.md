# Box Application using React

1. A simple Box Office Application where user can look for any movie/tv show or an actor.
2. There are 2 route pages; Home and Starred.
3. In Home page, user can look for his desired movie/tv show or actor. He/she just had to check on either of the radio buttons; Shows or Actors. Then, he/she had to type the required results in the search input field, and on entering he/she sees desired result(s).
4. Searching for an actor will result in rendering that actor's details; his origin, date of birth, gender, date of death (if any of these are known).
5. While searching for any movie/show, each results will have its name, description, read more option and star button. Clicking on Star button of any show result will star that result as user's favorite (or preferrence). That starred result is stored in the local storage and can be found in the Starred Route Page (which was initially empty, showing no results).
6. User can also unstar any show. Doing this, will remove that particular result from Starred Route Page and also from local storage.
7. On clicking Read More button for any show, user visits another Route Page and sees more details about that particular show; which includes rating, genre tags, details about its current status and the network it is/was premiered upon, no of seasons and episodes in each seasons, and the main casts for that show.
8. User can also keep track of all the moves made in the current game history section.
